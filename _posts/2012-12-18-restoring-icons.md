Today I restored user-friendly icons in the ADL editor. These icons are focused on the role of syntaxic elements, and were used in MindEd 0.2.1.

## Examples

<!--- use HTML5 figure and figcaption baby ! -->

<table>
<tr><td>
<figure>
	<img src="/images/Icons_Outline0.png" title="Icons in outline example (1/2)" alt="Icons in outline example (1/2)"/>
	<figcaption>Icons in outline example (1/2)</figcaption>
</figure>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<figure>
	<img src="/images/Icons_Outline1.png" title="Icons in outline example (2/2)" alt="Icons in outline example (2/2)"/>
	<figcaption>Icons in outline example (2/2)</figcaption>
</figure>
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>
<figure>
	<img src="/images/Icons_ContentAssist.png" title="Icons in content assist" alt="Icons in content assist"/>
	<figcaption>Icons in content assist</figcaption>
</figure>
</td></tr>
</table>   
   
   
   
### Note
The solution that was applied is temporary before further work on the GMF visual editor in 2013. Resources were directly copied in the ADL editor and used as described here: [Xtext & Label Providers](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation.html#labelProvider)
